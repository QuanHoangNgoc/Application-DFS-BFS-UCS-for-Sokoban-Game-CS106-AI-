## üìñ What Is It?
This project explores the implementation of search algorithms‚ÄîDepth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Uniform Cost Search (UCS)‚Äîto solve the Sokoban game, which is modeled as a search problem. The main aim is to investigate their effectiveness through detailed experimentation and statistical analysis.

## üéØ Why Do We Do It?
- **Educational Purpose**: To gain hands-on experience with classic search algorithms and their applications in solving real-world problems, specifically within the context of the Sokoban game.
- **Comparative Analysis**: To evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of DFS, BFS, and UCS in tackling Sokoban, with the goal of determining the most efficient algorithm.

## üë• Who Is the User?
This project is ideal for:
- **Students**: Those studying algorithms and AI who want a practical understanding of search techniques.
- **Game Developers**: Individuals looking to implement AI solutions in gaming.
- **Hobbyists**: Anyone interested in the intersection of algorithms and puzzles.
