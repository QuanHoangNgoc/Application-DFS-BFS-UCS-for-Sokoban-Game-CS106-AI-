### üìö About

Embark on a journey into the world of search algorithms applied to the Sokoban game, modeled as a search problem:

- **Project Scope**: Implement DFS, BFS, and UCS algorithms to solve the Sokoban game, exploring their effectiveness through experiments and statistical analysis.
- **Algorithm Comparison**: Evaluate DFS, BFS, and UCS in the context of Sokoban, with UCS emerging as the preferred algorithm.
- **Technical Implementation**: Python is used for algorithm implementation; however, runtime performance is suboptimal. Consider utilizing C++ for enhanced efficiency through optimized data and control structures.

# üöÄ Pipeline

- Implementation of DFS, BFS, UCS algorithms with detailed comments.
- Setup of pygame and pyautogui libraries for the Sokoban game.
- Configuration of the source code for experimental purposes.
- Extensive experimentation and statistical analysis using resources like Kaggle Colab P100 with 29GB RAM.
- Presentation of findings in a comprehensive project report.

# ‚öôÔ∏è How to Install This Project

- Download all source code and run `Sokoban.py` to play the game.
- Modify configurations in `constants.py` for project customization.
- Organized as an MVC model: View (`Sokoban.py`) and Controller (`Game.py`).
- Modify algorithms in `solver.py` under `auto_move()`.

### üîß Requirements

- Python >= 3.0
- pygame
- pyautogui
