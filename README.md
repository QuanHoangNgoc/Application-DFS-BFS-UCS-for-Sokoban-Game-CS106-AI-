### about 
- In this project, we install search algorithms such as DFS, BFS, UCS to apply them to solve the sokoban game by modeling them as a search problem. We also conduct experiments and statistics to compare algorithms as well as evaluate the difficulty of the game.
- We can model Sokoban World by a search problem and apply algorithms such as DFS, BFS, UCS to search for a solution (a path) that can win the game.
- In these cases, UCS appears to be the better algorithm.
- There are many different ways to define the difficulty of the game, but if measured in terms of time, it seems that levels 18 and 5 are the most difficult.
- In the source code of this project, we use Python Programming Language to implement the algorithms, but the run time of programs is too long and slow (up hours). Instead of, you can use C++ as the backend of algorithms, it will significantly improve speed of algorithms based on data structure and  control structure, thus reducing the time and resources needed to experiment.
